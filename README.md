# Text File Merger and Splitter

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of merging multiple .txt files from a specified directory into a single file and then splits the output into multiple files based on a user-defined maximum number of lines per file.


## Features

- Merge .txt Files: Combines all .txt files from a specified folder into one cohesive output.
- Split Output: The combined output is split into multiple files, each containing a maximum number of lines as specified by the user.
- Automatic Folder Creation: If the specified output folder doesn't exist, the script will automatically create it.




## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Access to the folder containing .txt files you wish to merge.

## Example
> If your input folder contains several .txt files and you set a limit of 1000 lines per output file, the script will generate multiple files (output_1.txt, output_2.txt, etc.) in the specified output folder.
